# Render block

Render part of a texture to a rect based on the x and y of the texture

Each block in the image is 200x200, which is set in the TEXTURE_WIDTH and TEXTURE_HEIGHT, 
and mapped in the initializeBlocks method. To print a block, just pass the name of the block
and the coordinated in which it should be rendered.
